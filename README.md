Specialized in Highly Complex Projects.
Software Engineer, Programmer & Content Creator.

I've been working in the Computer industry for more than _10_ years, Currently working with international clients.

Not every business is my client, though. Some signs we might not be a good fit include:
1. The company is struggling to pay salaries.
2. "Respect for others" is not a core value.

Thank You.
